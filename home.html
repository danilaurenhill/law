  <h3> ~ About Us ~ </h3>

  <p>SZS’s attorneys are highly skilled practitioners, most with many years of experience. We have trained at the nation’s leading law schools and practiced in some of the nation’s largest and most prestigious law firms. Our clients hire us for that experience and for our records of success as trial lawyers, as counselors and as professionals. They know they will receive the personal attention of senior counsel throughout a representation. Our firm is not structured as a pyramid, supported by a broad base of junior lawyers. Rather, we rely on the judgment that comes with years of experience and on the intelligent use of our own talents and the talents of our colleagues, as well as of resources and technology available within and outside the Firm.</p>

  <p>We came together because we share the view that our practice will flourish free from the inefficiencies inherent in a large bureaucracy. We also share the view that our clients can best be served in an institution of our own design – where we can write on a clean slate in every new matter and where we ourselves can thrive as entrepreneurs and individuals.</p>

  <p>We are zealous as advocates, and vigilant as managers. This gives us a genuine affinity for our clients’ challenges in managing their own affairs and the legal problems they bring to us.</p>
