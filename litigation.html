In one of these cases, we obtained dismissal and an award of attorneys’ fees under a California anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute that protects against lawsuits that stifle communication in the public interest, an emerging issue in laws regulating the Internet.

    </li>

    <li>We have represented the guardians of most of the severely mentally disabled persons residing in The Southbury Training School (“STS”), the only residential facility housing the disabled in the State of Connecticut, and a private Foundation established by past and current guardians to ensure the quality of life at the facility.  STS has been home to its residents for most of their lives.  A central issue in the cases is the belief by many of the guardians that STS is the only viable location for the care of their wards.  In one of the cases, the Firm, in tandem with the State of Connecticut, prosecuted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit an appeal against the Justice Department challenging a finding in the District Court that the State was in contempt of a 1986 Consent Decree and Judgment relating to the operation of the facility.  The Firm presented the argument of first impression that the procedures employed by the Justice Department in winning the contempt order under the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act are not available to seek contempt sanctions in the context of claimed violations of a Consent Decree.  In the second case, a class action brought in the name of the wards of the Firm’s clients but funded by private interest groups, we represented the same guardians in an unprecedented request to the District Court that their wards be permitted to opt out of the class.  Opting out typically is unavailable in class action civil rights litigation.  In excess of 82% of the class members joined the motion to opt out of the class.
