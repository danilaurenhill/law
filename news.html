    <h2>Jonathan M. Landers -- Rounding the Square Peg: Clarifying the Jurisprudence of the Sale Model of Chapter 11</h2>
    <h3>Abstract:  Historically, the reorganization of bankruptcy cases involving an operating business culminated in a confirmed Chapter 11 plan.  And, Chapter 11 had numerous statutory provisions protecting various creditor rights and assuring a fair and equitable treatment of all constituencies.  However, in the last ten or so years, although most cases involving an operating business have culminated in a so-called Section 363 sale free and clear of liens and claims rather than a confirmed plan, Section 363 has almost none of the protections for creditors and other constituencies found in Chapter 11.  This article discusses how the courts have filled the gap and in effect smoothed the rough edges of the Section 363 sale process for the sale of an operating business.  It begins by discussing recent limitations of appellate courts on the use of the equitable mootness doctrine to prevent judicial review, by limiting its application to protection of new money parties and situations where it would be impossible to unscramble the situation. The article then discusses a number of frequent issues arising in Section 363 sales but not dealt with in the Bankruptcy Code — the absolute priority rule and possible payments to subordinate creditors, dismissal of the case after the sale is over, equal treatment of creditors, and releases.  The article concludes stating that Section 363 is being used “in ways never contemplated by the drafters of the Bankruptcy Code,” that the result is lower costs and greater efficiency, but such benefits “should not be at the expense of the carefully crafted protections inherent in plan confirmation.”

    <h2>Jonathan M. Landers -- Recent Developments Under Stern v. Marshall</h2>
    <h3>The Supreme Court’s decision in Stern v. Marshall in 2011 created great uncertainty regarding the power of bankruptcy judges to make final decisions on a wide variety of cases and issues.  Last year, the Court’s decision in the Wellness case held that the parties could confer such power by consent.  This article surveys the run up to Wellness, the uncertainty regarding what were “Stern Claims” and post-Wellness decisions addressing Stern issues.   It concludes that although Wellness provided a “way out” of Stern in the form of consent, many of the Stern issues remain including the viability of equitable mootness, the uncertainty of what is a Stern Claim, various procedural issues, and a number of issues in business cases including the question of Stern’s application in cases involving executory contracts. The article concludes that, for now, Stern seems to be in hibernation, but it may reappear with unpredictable consequences at any time.

    <h2>Robert J. Shansky -- A Comprehensive Paper on Ground Leases
Presented to The American College of Real Estate Lawyers</h2>
    <h3>This article discusses the use of ground leases by owners and developers and operators of real estate which continues to be an important method used by individuals, families, business entities, governmental agencies, educational, religious and other not-for-profit institutions to accomplish their goals with respect to the use and disposition of land and improvements.  The sale and purchase of properties subject to ground leases is a source of raising and investing capital.  The reasons why various parties enter into ground leases have been reviewed before, but since this transaction structure continues to be used in ways that are changing neighborhoods and cities it is worthwhile to look again at how ground leases are being used and their impact on the parties thereto and affected locations.</h3>

    <h2>Jonathan M. Landers -- The Changing Face of Chapter 11 for Large Operating Businesses</h2>
    <h3>Today, operating businesses come to bankruptcy ready to roll with major components of their future operating and debt restructuring plans in place.  The plans generally contemplate a fast-track sale, often to secured lenders and/or vulture investors, and the sale takes place quickly and the case is over except for picking up the pieces that are left.  Many long-established bankruptcy practices and doctrines are swept aside or ignored, and important protections for creditors not involved in the sale process have been lost.  This article briefly examines the new regimen and asks basic questions about the new reality and the things that have been left behind.</h3>

    <h2>Jonathan M. Landers -- The Future of Avoidance Powers in Commercial Cases</h2>
    <h3>In recent years, developments have significantly undermined the avoidance powers of the Bankruptcy Code.  These include the settlement payments defense in section 546(e), special provisions and protections for creditors, litigation developments making avoidance litigation longer, more expensive and less likely to be successful, and service and collection issues for foreign entities.  There is, however, a serious question as to the purpose and effectiveness of avoidance powers, and whether they should be retained at all, let alone in their present form.  This article concludes with some suggestions which would limit the application of statutory avoidance provisions to situations where they would be more useful in today’s cases, and remove some constraints on their ability to accomplish their intended purposes. </h3>
